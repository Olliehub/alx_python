A README file on Python - Object-relational mapping

**Requirements:**

General
Recommended editors: Visual studio code
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
Your files will be executed with MySQLdb version 1.3.x
Your files will be executed with SQLAlchemy version 1.2.x
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
You are not allowed to use execute with sqlalchemy

Task 0: Get all states
Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported

Task 1: Filter states
Write a script that lists all states with a name starting with N (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported

Task 2: Filter states by user input
Write a script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument.

Your script should take 4 arguments: mysql username, mysql password, database name and state name searched (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
You must use format to create the SQL query with the user input
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported

Task 3: SQL Injection...
Wait, do you remember the previous task? Did you test "Arizona'; TRUNCATE TABLE states ; SELECT * FROM states WHERE name = '" as an input?

guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ ./2-my_filter_states.py root root hbtn_0e_0_usa "Arizona'; TRUNCATE TABLE states ; SELECT * FROM states WHERE name = '"
(2, 'Arizona')
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ ./0-select_states.py root root hbtn_0e_0_usa
guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ 
What? Empty?

Yes, it’s an SQL injection to delete all records of a table…

Once again, write a script that takes in arguments and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument. But this time, write one that is safe from MySQL injections!

Your script should take 4 arguments: mysql username, mysql password, database name and state name searched (safe from MySQL injection)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported

Task 4: Cities by states
Write a script that lists all cities from the database hbtn_0e_4_usa

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by cities.id
You can use only execute() once
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported

Task 5: All cities by state
Write a script that takes in the name of a state as an argument and lists all cities of that state, using the database hbtn_0e_4_usa

Your script should take 4 arguments: mysql username, mysql password, database name and state name (SQL injection free!)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by cities.id
You can use only execute() once
The results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported
